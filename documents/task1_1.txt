### Exposed and Control 

Exposed - contains users who are shown the smart ad.
Control - contains user who are shown the dumy add. 

### How to target the users? 


###  Could we use the counts of yes and no answers to make a judgment 
on which experiment is performing better? For example if #yes > #no 
for the exposed group than the control group, could we declare that
 the ad had a significant impact Why or why not?

 - no, because we have to first check the statistical significancy of hte result and its practival significance
 - the result may be due to the randomization of the data, we may accidently get many users in one group
